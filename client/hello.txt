Hey there delilah whats it like in new york city.
I am thosands miles away but tonight you look so pretty 
yes you doo 
waking up to kiss you 
when nobody's there 
smell of your prefume still 
struck in the air
it so hard 
I wanna tell you everything things I never got to say for the forst time
If the whole world is watching I'll still dance with you \

over and over the only truth everything comes back to you
